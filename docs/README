Introduction
============

Setting up Printers via CUPS Web Interface
==========================================

First open a web browser and surf to the page: http://localhost:631/ which is
the configuration page for CUPS. The image below shows the default page you
should be greeted with.

To setup a print queue you have to access the CUPS administrative page by
clicking on the text that reads "Administrator". Upon clicking that you should
be greeted with the following page.

.. image:: images/cups_admin.png

To access the administrative facilities you're going to have to provide a
username and password as shown in the following image.

.. image:: images/cups_password_check.png

The username to log in is "root". root is the super user for your *nix based
machine be it Mac OSX, Ubuntu GNU/Linux, etc... The password for the root user
might not be known to you. Oftentimes in modern Operating System installs the
root user's password is scrambled to protect the machine from possibly security
compromise.

However, try to login as root using the same password as what you use to login
to your own account. If that fails to work then you'll need to reset the root
password. Details for doing that are contained in the section `Setting root's
password`.

We proceed with adding a printer to cups as shown in the next screenshot.

Setting up a Laser Cutter Queue
-------------------------------

To add a laser cutter click the radio button that reads "Laser Cutter (thin red
lines vector cut)" as shown in the next screenshot.

.. image:: images/cups_add_printer_laser_cutter.png
   :width: 400


Now you will be prompted for the connection type. This portion of the setup is
critical as the text you type here controls how the laser cutter behaves when
jobs are printed to this queue. A basic laser cutter setup string is shown
below.

.. image:: images/cups_add_printer_connection.png
   :width: 400

What you see in the above screenshot is the following string::

  laser-cutter://epilog_mini/rp=100/rs=100/vp=100/vs=10/vf=5000/rm=grey/af=1

In our lab the laser cutter's address on the network is bound to the hostname
epilog_mini which coincides with IP address 192.168.254.4. Therefore specifying
192.168.254.4 rather than epilog_mini would have worked equally well making our
settings string::

  laser-cutter://192.168.254.4/rp=100/rs=100/vp=100/vs=10/vf=5000/rm=grey/af=1

Now let's discuss the rest of the string which includes settings for the
cutter. You'll note that all instructions are in a key/value form like::

  some_letters=some_value

where some_letters are something like "rp" or "rs" and some value is a number
like 100 or some text. Each of these keys represent a setting for the cutter
and the value is some number that is dependent upon that setting.

Chart of Laser Cutter Setting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here is a chart showing the available laser cutter settings.

+------------------+---------------------+------------------+------------------+


So setting up a queue for matteboard might involve a string such as::

  laser-cutter://192.168.254.4/r=300/rp=45/rs=100/vp=50/vs=30/vf=10/rm=grey/af=1

which would set resolution to 300 dpi, raster power 45, raster speed 100,
vector power 50, vector speed 30, vector frequency 10, raster mode = grey, and
auto focus is enabled. The most interesting setting here is vector frequency
set to 10 which means that the laser is going to cut on and off 10 times per a
second.


Following setting the queue's options we name the printer, add a description,
and specify the location of the printer. The name of the printer and
description is critical towards making sure that users know what type of queue
they are printing to. For the queue we're setting up we specified that this
queue is intended to be used for 2 inch wood. When users search the network for
other print queues the name and description play a critical role towards
directing print jobs to a queue that matches the correct material in the laser
cutter.

.. image:: images/cups_add_printer_name_description_location.png
   :width: 400

When specifying the make of the laser cutter, choose "Raw". Raw will allow the
software sending the print job to decide for itself how to send the job. In the
case of Inkscape the job will be sent to the laser cutter in .pdf form.

.. image:: images/cups_add_printer_make.png
   :width: 400

Because the Make was chosen as "Raw" we choose the "Raw Queue" for the printer
model type.

.. image:: images/cups_add_printer_model.png
   :width: 400

Do not change any of the default options.

.. image:: images/cups_add_printer_default_options.png
   :width: 400

Now you should be presented with a setup completed screen. You now have a print
queue for cutting 2 inch wood.

.. image:: images/cups_add_printer_setup_completed.png
   :width: 400

Now you can verify that the settings you created by checking your available
print queues in the gnome print manager.

.. image:: images/ubuntu_printer_configuration_post_cups.png
   :width: 200

Viewing the properties of the queue shows similar information to what was set
via CUPS.

.. image:: images/ubuntu_printer_configuration_post_cups2.png
   :width: 200

Congratulations, you have now setup a print queue for printing to 2 inch wood
for your laser cutter.


Setting up a Vinyl Cutter Queue
-------------------------------

To add a vinyl cutter click the radio button that reads "Vinyl Cutter (thin red
lines vector cut)" as shown in the next screenshot.

.. image:: images/cups_add_printer_vinyl_cutter.png
   :width: 400


If your vinyl cutter is attached via a USB/serial device specify the connection
to the vinyl cutter similar to the image shown in the following screenshot.

.. image:: images/cups_add_printer_vinyl_cutter_usb_attached.png
   :width: 400

which is::

  vinyl-cutter://ttyUSB0/

If your vinyl cutter is attached via a serial to network converted like ours is
then specify the settings for the vinyl cutter similar to the following screenshot.

.. image:: images/cups_add_printer_vinyl_cutter_network_attached.png
   :width: 400

which is::

  vinyl-cutter://192.168.254.6:9100/

for the device with IP address 192.168.254.6 listening on port 6001.

Now you need to specify the name and description. Here again its important to
choose a reasonable name for the vinyl cutter especially if you will be sharing
this print queue with others.

.. image:: images/cups_add_printer_vinyl_cutter_name_and_description.png
   :width: 400

Now we setup the make for the vinyl cutter. In our lab we own the Epilog Camm-1
vinyl cutter. The cups fab software installs a postscript printer definition
(ppd) which defines our vinyl cutter and forces software sending jobs to it to
send them as postscript jobs. In the screenshot below you'll note that Roland
was chosen as the make for the printer.

.. image:: images/cups_add_printer_vinyl_cutter_make.png
   :width: 400

Now choose the cooresponding model Camm-1.

.. image:: images/cups_add_printer_vinyl_cutter_model.png
   :width: 400

Now set the default layout for pages sent to the vinyl cutter. Please note that
this is nothing more than an aesthetic setting at the moment but might contain
meaning later.

.. image:: images/cups_add_printer_vinyl_cutter_general_options.png
   :width: 400

Finally you are presented with the printer settings page.

.. image:: images/cups_add_printer_vinyl_cutter_completed.png
   :width: 400

Congratulations you have properly setup a vinyl cutter that is printable via
standard software such as Inkscape.


Setting root's password
=======================

Probably the easiest way to reset root's password is to just use a terminal to
switch to the root user then execute the passwd command to reset root's
password.

First you'll have to open a terminal. In Ubuntu this is done through Clicking
the following items:
Applications -> Accessories -> Terminal
Under Mac OSX you open your Finder, choose Applications, then Utilities, then
Terminal.

A screenshot of a typical terminal is shown below.

.. image:: images/terminal_default.png
   :alt: A typical terminal.
   :width: 300


Now we use the sudo command to switch user to root. To do this type something
like::

  sudo su -

which will use sudo to execute the command su - which will switch user to
root. A screenshot of the output is shown below.

.. image:: images/terminal_sudo_to_root.png
   :alt: Using sudo to switch to the root user.
   :width: 300

Now type the password you use to login to the machine. If you do not know the
password that you use to log into the machine then we cannot proceed and you
should consult someone else as to what your password might be. I suggest trying
to guess the password.

.. image:: images/terminal_logged_in_as_root.png
   :alt: Logged in as the root user.
   :width: 300

After switching to the root user you should see a screen like the
following. The key to knowing whether or not you are acting as the root user
under the BASH shell (the shell used by the terminal) is to look at the line
and note the trailing "#" character at the end of the line.


Now you need to use the password command to set root's password. To do this
type the command::

  passwd

You should then see a screen similar to the following.

.. image:: images/terminal_set_root_password.png
   :alt: Set the root password.
   :width: 300


You are now required to type your new root password twice. Type the password
once, then press enter. Now type it again and press enter. If you fail to type
the password the same both times then you will receive a failure
message. Otherwise you will be presented with a successful message as shown in
the following screenshot.

.. image:: images/terminal_set_root_password_completed.png
   :alt: Successfully set the root password.
   :width: 300

Known Bugs
----------

Inkscape Bug
~~~~~~~~~~~~

One well known and nasty bug occurs with Inkscape > 0.47. It seems that
Inkscape automatically puts documents into landscape mode when the document
width is greater than the document's height.

During printing Inkscape sends the document to Cairo which generates the PDF
that is then ultimately passed on to the printer. The problem here is that
Cairo does not properly pass the Landscape mode information off to the print
server so what happens is that documents arrive in the cups backends rotated 90
degrees counter-clockwise.

There exists no method of automatically correcting for this behavior at this
time. When using the vinyl cutter please make sure that the document's height
is greater than the document's width to force the document to be sent in
portrait mode.

When using the laser cutter, either specify that the output should be rotated
90 degrees (clockwise).


Laser Cutter Bug
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The laser cutter software currently lacks an equivalent level of debugging
information that is present in the vinyl-cutter software. Part of this is due
to the current transition of the laser-cutter software from the version written
in C to the Python version. In addition the C version of the software emits
Bitmaps for the raster images which can be rather large (24 in by 12 in) with
no compression.
